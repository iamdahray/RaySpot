i Did my IT at the governors office at oke-mosan abeokuta in the Ministry of envuironment which was headed by Mr. Agbaje as at that time!
I came to lagos for my NYSC service but i was originally posted to sokot where i did my Three weeks Orientation camp there.
I was unab;le to complete the programme with my colleagues cause of the corona vurus pandemic which resulted in the halting of the programme up till this moment.
We are not yet sure if we are to resume back to camp after the whole pandemic but one thing is certain, i can't go back to that far distance cause the journey is risky and long.
The government have to be considerate and allow people stay in their current states most especially those that have redeployed already.
The government are doing us well by paying everybody's monthly allowance which is a sign of good faith from the governmnt to the Corps mempers.
